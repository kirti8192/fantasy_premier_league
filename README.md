# FPL Machine Learning Project

This project uses historical Fantasy Premier League (FPL) data to build predictive models that help with player selection decisions.

## Problem 1: Predicting Fantasy Points for a Gameweek [Linear Regression]

Given player stats for a particular gameweek (e.g., GW38), predict each player's `total_points` using other stats from the same gameweek. This is a regression problem where the model is trained and evaluated on different players from the same week.
